    description: "Developing massively parallel multiphysics framefork for solving coupled systems
      of partial differential equations using non-linear solvers and Jacobian-Free Newton Krylov methods
      in C++ - MOOSE. Namely responsible for discontinuos Galerkin method, adaptive time-stepping
      methods, time integration system, time predictor system, initial condition subsytem, support
      for variables that do not live on mesh (scalars), enhancements of single matrix preconditioning.

      <p>Developing a code for solving a thermomechanical contact problem using Mortar method for BISON,
      Rattlesnake and bighorn.</p>

      <p>Design and development of the next generation nuclear power plant safety code – RELAP-7.
      Currently the software lead, managing the code review process, bug tracking system and
      merge-request-based code development cycle.</p>"

    position: Software Developer of hp-FEM in 3D
    start: 2006
    end: March 2010
    description: "Developing a library for solving systems of PDE in 3D using hp-adaptivity,
      arbitrary level hanging nodes and multi-mesh assembling. Last two features are currently unique
      features (according to authors knowledge) in existing FEM codes. Responsibilities included software
      design, implementation, testing and verification of the code as well as solving real-world
      problems. Latest work included incorporation of non-linear solvers (currently Trilinos),
      implementing Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov method, support for iterative solvers and
      development of parallel version."

    start: 2005
    end: 2008
    description: "Design and implementation for several smaller and larger applications for Pocket PC
      platform. Applications distributed as a freeware via <code>pda.jasnapaka.com</code> web pages. In 2008, projects
      transformed into open source projects. Work included communication with users, solving their
      problems, implementing new features, testing, development and design of the software."
