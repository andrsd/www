__Before you go__: The first part of this hike (about 6 miles) follows a very faint trail. If vanishes at spots and there is some bushwhacking
involved. It is recommended you use the GPX file, it will be quite handy. Fording is involved in this section.

After the first part, the trial connects to Teton Crest trail and will take you through Bitch Creek Narrows to Hidden Corral Basin.
From here you continue to Dead Horse Pass (about 9,490 ft) and then descent to the valley and follow the Badger Creek Trail back
to Indian Meadows trailhead (or Rammel Mountain Rd - that's how it is marked on the signs).

Water is available at several spots and easily accessible from the trail.

If you do not want to do the whole loop, you can hike just the southern fork to Dead Horse Pass, which would be about 6 miles one way.
