For this hike you will need a shuttle and possibly fording shoes. It is possible
to ford all creeks without fording shoes, but bringing them will make it easier.

The first part of the trail climbs up to Phillips Pass and is very easy to follow.

Then if follows on the west side of the Teton Mountain Range in higher altitude, so
count with snow fields earlier in the season. The trail is vanishing at spots, but
it is not bad.

When you get to the most northern point, you hike downhill to meet the Moose Lake
trail. If you have time, you can visit Moose Lake, it will add about 5 km to your
trip. On this section, there is several fords, some easier, some more difficult.
Watch for the turn that goes to the Coal Creek. The sign will be on your right
(probably "buried" in the grass). There will be another more difficult ford.

Follow the trail up to the Coal Creek Pass, enjoy the view up in the pass and
continue on the obvious trail back to the parking lot.  Just before you get to the
parking lot, there is one more ford.
