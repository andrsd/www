  In Leadore, ID turn on Lee Creek Road and follow signs to Mill Creek Rd. After
  about 7.5 miles turn left onto forest road 010 (there will be a sign to Mill
  Lake) and continue to the intersection at mile 9.5. Turn onto forest road 006
  and continue to the primitive trail head (about mile 12).  The road gets
  gradually worse. It should be doable with sedan. Easier when there was no rain.
  4WD and high clearance vehicle is an advantage.

The trail is an 4WD road going to the Mill Lake. It is easy to follow and there
is no steep climb/descent.  Early in the season it has muddy spots, but nothing
serious.  The trail crosses Mill Creek and you may need to ford it, especially
early in the season, but the ford is very easy.

There is a primitive camp site by the lake.
