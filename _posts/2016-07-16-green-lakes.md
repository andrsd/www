The trail is well defined and easy to follow all the way. If you do not want to do the
whole "loop", just hike the north part that will take you to Green Lakes Basin, about 6 miles (10 km) from the trail head.

First lake you get to is Green Lake.

But I highly recommend to continue to the basin.

The trail continues to the [Granite Basin](granite-basin-lakes)

Water is available at several spots and easily accessible from the trail.
