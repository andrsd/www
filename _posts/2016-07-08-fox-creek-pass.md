__Before you go__: This trail does not get a lot of traffic, so it is not very easy to follow it. There
is quite a bit of fording involved -- no logs, no bridges.

From the trailhead, start on the path that has a sign and continues to the quarry road. There is another
path following the creek, which will also take you to the road, but it is a bit steeper and rougher.

Once on the road to the quarry, watch for this view.

You want to cross the creek to the other side somewhere in between the big boulder and the big tree on
the right.  There is a sign behind the bush that says "Fox Creek Pass 10" and you will be on the trial.

I was able to hike for about 4 miles (6 km) when I got to a spot where I was not able to find how the
trail continued, so I turned and headed back.  Along the hike, the trail would disappear and reappear
quite often, especially when it get to a creek and crosses it.  Have a good map with you.
I used USGS one and it helped a lot.
